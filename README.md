# AzureFunctionAsyncServiceTemplate
A template for creating async services using Azure serverless functions and c# .NET. It is a queue rather than log-based implementation for buiding asynchronous services.

This service template targets Azure HTTP-triggered functions for request ingress and Azure service bus queues and topics for async message processing. It includes a number of patterns:
1. The inbox/outbox service base pattern. This is a personal pattern and so is not in the public domain.
2. An understanding of messages and how they sub-divide into commands and events.
3. An understanding of Local, Private, Public messages.
4. Use of a fully-qualified event name (FQEN) and event short name.
5. Capture and handling of transient exceptions and non-transient exceptions. Transient exceptions propogated up to the service bus for retry; non-transient exceptions explicity dead-lettered.

Other technical features include:
1. Selection of appropriate non-default serverless function bindings in order to have full access to the underlying service bus - for explicit dead-lettering and also access to the message header, not just the payload.
2. Use of custom IoC container (Autofac) for using "named registrations", which is a big feature missing from the built in .NET container.
3. Base classes implementing GoF template method pattern for processing ingress requests (http) and queue processing.
4. Transmitting and enforcing use of the FQEN and event short name. Populating the command/event "subject" property - useful for viewing in Azure Service Bus Event Explorer.

# Definitions: Messages, Commands, Events
- Messages sent to queues / subscriptions.
- Commands instructions to do something – generally to queues – P2P.
- Events notify that something has been done – generally to topics – P2MP.
- Claim-check pattern for large payloads in order to avoid resource quota issues affecting performance and, in extreme situations, shutting down queues.
- Events should represent the state change of a business process and described in business terms – similar to the distinction between BDD and TDD.
- Low-level CRUD events tend to carry less business meaning and ideally do not belong on the service bus – CDC is ideal for these.

# Definitions: Local, Private, Public Events

This analogy - between the state and behaviour within a class and the same within an enterprise - is useful. A class contains variables and behaviour and an enterprise contains messages and behaviour (Services). Functions within a class represent services within the enterprise class. Variables within a class are analagous with messages within the enterprise. Just as a class of code has local, private, public variables, so does an enterprise comprise local, private and public events. Local events are used within the bounds of a single service - eg for offloading and resiliency ("temporal decoupling"). Private events are messages exchanged between services within the enterprise. Public messages are messages sent outside of the enterprise.

# To Run this Template
Start by stepping through the template itself in Visual Studio.
1. Create service bus resource and add the connection to the appsettings.local.json file:

There is an inbox queue and outbox queue (topic) for this service. Then there are the config enries for the two requests supported by this service - apples and oranges.

2. Create service inbox queue "sbqService1_inbox_fruitToDo".
3. Create service outbox topic.
4. Create service outbox subscription "sbtService1_outbox_fruitDone".
5. Running by default on localhost:7046. See http function URIs: 
    "http://localhost:7046/api/HTTPApplesFuncRun"
    "http://localhost:7046/api/HTTPOrangesFuncRun" in the test web age index.html in the root of the project.
6. Fire-up the test harness web page or use postman to send a request for apples. Put a breakpoint inside of (1) the applles func and then (2) the queue processing func.
